Your programâ€™s output should be similar to the sample run output shown here. However, because your program randomly chooses the determiners, nouns, and verbs, your program will generate different sentences than the six shown here.

Some girls thought.
One man eats.
Many dogs run.
The woman will think.
Many men will write.
